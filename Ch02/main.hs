-- Exercise 2.1 The above example is fairly concrete, in that, for one, it
-- is rooted in C major, and furthermore it has a fixed tempo. Define
-- a function twoFiveOne :: Pitch -> Dur -> Music Pitch such that
-- twoFiveOne p d constructs a ii-V-I chord progression in the key whose
-- major scale begins on the pitch p (i.e. the first degree of the major
-- scale on which the progression is being constructed), where the
-- duration of the first two cho rds is each d , and the duration of the
-- last chord is 2 âˆ— d
--
-- Notes:
-- The function `trans` takes an int `n` and a pitch and transposes the
-- pitch `n` semitones, i.e., 
-- trans :: Int -> Pitch -> Pitch
twoFiveOne :: Pitch -> Dur -> Music Pitch
-- Second degree of a major scale is up one whole step (2 semitones)
-- Fifth degree of a major scale is up: whole, whole, half, whole
-- or 2 + 2 + 1 + 2 = 7 semitones
